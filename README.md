## 🧠 Why I Built This

I built Broncho Books to help UCO students easily exchange textbooks and to deepen my skills in full-stack web development, RESTful API design, and modern React state management.

---

## 👨‍💻 My Role

- Designed and implemented the **frontend** using React and Chakra UI  
- Developed **backend APIs** with Node.js and Express  
- Integrated **MongoDB** for book and user data  
- Managed state with Zustand for a scalable React architecture  
- Led the full development lifecycle, from database modeling to UI/UX
